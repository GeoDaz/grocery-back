As you can see, I've created a nestjs application.
This is an API that provides data to the nextjs application. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete groceries.
It manages the user authentication and authorization, and their addition to the grocery list.
It uses Prisma as an ORM and MongoDB as a database.
